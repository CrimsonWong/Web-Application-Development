# Web-Application-Development

## Summary
This is the final project of INFO 6250 Web Tools and Web Design and this is an individual project. 
In my project, I developed a system for each customer in a community to post questions, answer questions from other customers and click like button if they like their answers. This online system is more like Quora and ZhiHu. Both of these processes will be finished through any web browser. 
This online application is able to manage 3 business, including managing customers, storing their submitted information, and calculating the answer situation.
